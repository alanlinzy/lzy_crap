Escape Room Added Features:
  tgao11: Red button that can be pressed repeatedly. First time it is pressed, the room time decrements by 2 when the time advances. The player is informed of this. Second time it is pressed, the room time decrement rate goes to 5 and the player is informed of it. The third time it is pressed, the room time decrement increases to 10, the player is informed, and the door unlocks, and the player hears a click. The point of this button is that it gives the player an easy way to escape the room but it involves hitting the button 3 times, and the first two times the button is hit, a negative effect happens to dissuade the player. The player is not directly told that the door is unlocked, only that they hear a click. They will have limited tries to open the door because the time decrement would be at 10 at that time, and the key flying around also triggers the time decrement.
 
  wli71: Repurposed the mirror to be a source of hint, with a drawback. Since the hairpin is removed (the chest is opened with a pad lock now), I repurposed the mirror to give hints on how to escape the room every time the player looks at it. However, looking at the mirror will increase "madness", which affects the game by asynchronously telling the player that he want's to look at the mirror again (thereby increasing the madness more). Each time this asynchronous event happens, timer will tick down. With maximum madness, it will happen every 3 secconds, so the player will have very little time to escape the room. 
  
  zlin32: Add bluebutton that can only be pressed once. If player press the button, then the player will fall into a trap room. Player can use UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, WAIT to manipulate themselves, "*" represents their position, "@" represent the exit of this trap room, "X" represent the trap in the trap room. The trap will change every time player move, if the player walk into the trap, the player will die. Otherwise the player walk into the exit, the player will escape from the trap room and go back to the escaperoom. The bluebutton will not be pressable after player escape from the trap room.
  
  han11: A coded lock on the chest. Description of the cipher is in Morse Code: .-- .... .- - / - .. -- . / .. ... / .. - ..--.. (English: What time is it?), the code is local time (i.e. 10:51am -> 1051). The player has 5 chances to enter the right code, each time the code display decreases by 1, and looking at chest or entered a wrong code will display remaining times to try. If the chances reaches 0, the coded lock will explode and you die. The point of this coded lock is setting obstacle in the regular way of escaping, and in the mean time making dead more easily. This will guide the player to think is there a better way to escape (press redbutton 3 times, get the extra life).
  
  xma39: Extra life: Add a guidebook, and if you look the guidebook, the description will give the hint tell the client to read the guidebook, and by reading the guidebook, the guidebook will tell client to type "team2 is the greatest team", then if the client type exactly the given sentence, the client will get supershoes, also the server will give the hint that now the client can try to "jump", then after the "jump", the client will get an extra life, which will give the client a second chance to play the game if then died. Also after the client used the extra life, then they will not be able to get a extra life again, which means they cannot play the game with infinent lifes. Also, the client cannot bypass typing "team2 is the greatest team" to get the extralife.
        Kill flyingkey: the flyingkey is really annoying sometimes, so I add a way to kill it, by typing the "kill flyingkey", the flying key agent will be stopped, and the location of the key will be set at the wall, also refresh the room description, so everything properly setted and just the flyingkey died.
        Server timeout and client output refresh: I set a timer for the server, which will close the connection in 60 seconds if the client not responding, and I added a asyncio reader for the test_client so it behaves just like the escaperoom, also I find that start the flying asyncio agents at the connection_made may cause a bug that sometimes the client may not be able to play with these asyncio agents, I don't know the reason, but after I put the code that start the agents after game.start(), problem solved.
